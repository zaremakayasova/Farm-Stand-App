NodeJS MongoDB DemoApp

Farm-Stand-DemoApp is an example of NodeJS application that works with MongoDB.

The application is a very simple list where you can add or delete new farm produce items(product name, price and category). Every product has its own category(fruit,vegetable,dairy). From each category we can access a list of all items related to a particular category.
