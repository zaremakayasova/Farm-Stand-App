NodeJS MongoDB Demo

Farm-Stand-App is an example of NodeJS application that works with MongoDB.

The application is a very simple list (farm produce items) where you can add or delete values.
Every product of the list has its name, price and category(fruit, vegetable, dairy). From each category you can access a list of all products related to a particular category.
